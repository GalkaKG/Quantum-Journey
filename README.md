### What is a Quantum?
Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales, such as atoms and subatomic particles. In the quantum world, particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously, a phenomenon known as superposition.

### What is Quantum in Computing?
Quantum computing utilizes the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations. Unlike classical computers that process data in binary form (0s and 1s), quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits, which can represent and process information in multiple states simultaneously, enabling them to solve certain problems much faster than classical computers.

### What is Quantum Supremacy?
Quantum supremacy refers to the theoretical milestone where a quantum computer outperforms the most powerful classical computers in solving a specific problem. It demonstrates the potential of quantum computing to achieve computational tasks beyond the capabilities of classical computers.

### What is Post-Quantum Cryptography?
Post-quantum cryptography is a field of study that focuses on developing cryptographic algorithms that are secure against attacks from quantum computers. As quantum computers pose a threat to traditional cryptographic methods, post-quantum cryptography aims to ensure the security of digital communication in the era of quantum computing.

### What is Quantum Cryptography?
Quantum cryptography leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to secure communication channels. It utilizes quantum key distribution protocols, such as the BB84 protocol, to enable secure transmission of encryption keys between parties by exploiting the properties of quantum states.

### Shor's Algorithm
Shor's algorithm is a quantum algorithm developed by mathematician Peter Shor in 1994. It is famous for its ability to efficiently factor large integers, a problem that is considered hard for classical computers. Shor's algorithm demonstrates the potential of quantum computers to solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical algorithms.

### What is a Quantum Circuit?
A quantum circuit is a model used to represent and perform quantum computations. It consists of quantum gates that manipulate qubits to perform operations such as superposition, entanglement, and measurement. Quantum circuits are analogous to classical circuits in classical computing and are fundamental to quantum algorithms.
